Begin AI (open devin) Code-Engineer Build.

Status : WIP

Using Visual Studio and Docker OpenDevin with Ollama/llama3 model

(step down to llama3.2:3b for faster results)

I am using Arc1x-Distro files to rebuild as Code (working or not) and putting in conversation files in an attempt to quickly build a first pass.
It will likely be very broken and at times not working or just plain wrong, because I want to try to surmount it on my own, it will be just AI-built.
1 Beginning with legacy 
2 Then virtual legacy.
3 Then Text Builds
4 Then Advanced Builds.
5 Then Extras by each Chapter. (References will be seperated)
6 Then Concept and or Template layouts.
7 And any additional chapters including notebooks which I might upload.

I will try to keep it organized. I don't know what will come out of the AI-assisted Builds but it is based on the resources I wrote myself, and how the ai chooses to interpret them in OpenDevin.

I am trying to use BOLT.new with Ollama because I am tired of OpenDevin. But I dunno if I can get it to work like I did with Opendevin. I am tired of thinking but I will find out sooner or later.
By the way I calculated that the project at 100k lines with each having 4-8 attempts, or being broken up into a million prompts. Well that would take me like a year and a half to do if it was automatic. IDK. Maybe, I am saying there is some math in there, I feel like it is realistically going to take at least 1-3 years without a team. And I dont have the money to pay for one or even at least pay someone else $10k to do everything. But if you want to, be my guest.
I am currently living in a scifi-fantasy-minecraft mindset with this idea, but I have written out everything to feel that it is more or less complete and ready to be BUILT if the ai-models are aggreable. TYPICALLY they need to be encouraged in the prompt with something like 

"MAKE A GAME ENGINE FROM :yadda yadda whatever the prompt I would put in here(a direct copy of any line i already wrote up)"
Yes I have gotten some code to work, and come close to making a base-game-engine, It's just too tiresome for me atm to really digest the scope of the actual project.
