# Arc1X-ENV-Full

Begin AI (open devin) Code-Engineer Build.
Status : WIP
Using Visual Studio and Docker OpenDevin with Ollama/llama3 model
(step down to llama3:7b for faster results)

I am using Arc1x-Distro files to rebuild as Code (working or not) and putting in conversation files in an attempt to quickly build a first pass.
It will likely be very broken and at times not working or just plain wrong, because I want to try to surmount it on my own, it will be just AI-built.
1 Beginning with legacy 
2 Then virtual legacy.
3 Then Text Builds
4 Then Advanced Builds.
5 Then Extras by each Chapter. (References will be seperated)
6 Then Concept and or Template layouts.
7 And any additional chapters including notebooks which I might upload.

I will try to keep it organized. I don't know what will come out of the AI-assisted Builds but it is based on the resources I wrote myself, and how the ai chooses to interpret them in OpenDevin.
